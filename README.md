## Overview

The goal of this lab is to learn what it means to be a "tidy" dataset and how to tidy messy datasets utilizing the `tidyr` package -- a core member of the `tidyverse`. 

Useful resources:

- [`tidyr` package home page](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
- [pivoting vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html)

## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L03_tidy_data.html`. A template is also provided (rename as lastname_firstname_L03.qmd).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
